  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Extension:</strong> <span id="ext-name">eledele</span></p>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> <span id="eff-date">9/7/2025</span></p>

  <h2>1. Single purpose</h2>
  <p>This extension has a single, narrow purpose: <em>to remove pesky elements</em>. It does not perform unrelated functions.</p>

  <h2>2. Summary of data practices</h2>
  <p><strong>Data collection:</strong> This extension <strong>does not collect or transmit any personal data</strong>. It does not access or store user names, email addresses, payment information, health data, or location data.</p>
  <p><strong>Local storage:</strong> The extension may store minimal configuration and preference values locally using the browser's storage APIs (for example: preferred settings, UI choices). This data remains on the user's device and is not sent to any external server.</p>

  <h2>3. Permissions and justification</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>activeTab</strong> — Temporarily used when a user activates the extension so it can operate on the current page the user selected.</li>
    <li><strong>tabs</strong> — Used only to identify or update the active tab as required by the extension's single purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>storage</strong> — Used to save lightweight user preferences locally (no personal data).</li>
    <li><strong>scripting</strong> — Used to inject or execute scripts only on pages where the user has explicitly requested the extension's feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Host permissions</strong> — If the extension requests access to specific domains, it is strictly to enable its core functionality on those sites and the scope is limited to the minimum required match patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Remote code</h2>
  <p>This extension <strong>does not</strong> load or execute remote JavaScript or WebAssembly at runtime. All code executed by the extension is bundled inside the extension package. If you do include external resources in the future, they will be noted here and reviewed for policy compliance.</p>

  <h2>5. Third parties and data sharing</h2>
  <p>The extension does not send user data to third parties, nor does it sell or transfer user data. No analytics or advertising SDKs that harvest user data are included.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>Only the minimal permissions needed to deliver the extension's single purpose are requested. Local data is stored using the browser's secure storage APIs. If any security incidents affecting user data occur, we will follow applicable disclosure and remedial procedures.</p>
